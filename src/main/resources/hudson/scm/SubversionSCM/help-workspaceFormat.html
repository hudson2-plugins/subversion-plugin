<div>
    Different versions of Subversion clients store data differently in the <tt>.svn</tt>
    directories. This option controls which version of Subversion the Hudson
    plugin emulates. Using an older version allows you to manipulate
    workspace with your older command line Subversion clients, while using a
    newer version allows you to use more advanced features added to later
    versions of Subversion, such as <tt>svn:externals</tt> support to a file.
